    "Moving to Sweden from Georgia  Hej, everyone!\n\nI'm a 22-year-old Georgian guy who's planning to move to Stockholm soon. This will be my first time living abroad and living alone, so I'm a bit nervous but also excited about this new adventure!\n\nI have a background in IT and have been working in the field for three years. I recently got my CCNA 200-301 certification (im aware that,it's an entry lvl), and I'm hoping to find work in the IT industry in Stockholm.\n\nOne of my biggest concerns right now is the renting system in Stockholm. I've been trying to research it online, but it's been a bit confusing. Can anyone explain how the renting system works, and what I should expect in terms of rental prices and availability?\n\nAs an \"antisocial\" or better to say shy person, I'm curious about the social life in Stockholm. I'm looking forward to meeting new people but I'm not sure where to start. What are some good places to hang out or meet people in Stockholm?\n\nI'm curious about job opportunities in the IT industry. I have some experience in the field, but I'm not sure what to expect in terms of job openings and competition. Does anyone have any advice or tips on finding work in the IT industry ?\n\nAlso,I'm trying to plan my budget for the move. I currently have about $5000 saved up, and I'm wondering if that would be enough to cover my expenses for a couple of months until I find work. Also, would I need to purchase health insurance in Sweden, or is it provided through the government?\n\nIn addition,I'm wondering if there are any guides or helpful videos that can help me understand what it's like living in Sweden and how to navigate the culture and customs better. Any recommendations would be appreciated!\n\nThanks for reading, and I look forward to your replies!",

    "I‚Äôm being laid off and my last date is 2 weeks after my work permit expires TL;DR getting laid off within 2 months of work permit renewal. It's the second renewal so if I get it I won't be dependent on a specific company. But a lawyer says I might not get it. Any similar experiences?\n\n\nHello Redditers, I moved to Sweden 2 years ago for work, now with my current employer they‚Äôre facing funding issues and that resulted on me being laid off, the timing is not the best because my work permit is expiring soon in June, meaning I basically have 2 months to start the extension process. This is my second period of the work permit where the work permit is going to be employer ind√©pendant but in the same time what the immigration agency my employer hired to help me with the extension process is saying that the migrationsverket need to know about the lay off and that my contract is not anymore permanent. \nRight now I‚Äôm confused I‚Äôm not sure if the fact that contract will end few days after my l work permit expiration could mean and refusal of the work permit extension all together, in the other hand before knowing this I was applying for job regardless if they can sponsor visa or not since my thinking was I‚Äôll get the work permit with two years validity but then I learned the validity is linked to contract duration, and if anything happens during the process of renewal like me actually getting laid off would probably results in a risk of me not getting the new work permit or less likely getting a work permit with a 3 weeks in it. \nSo far I didn‚Äôt sign the termination agreement and I‚Äôm negotiating with the employer to hold off the lay out till I get my work permit. Also I‚Äôm a Product designer in an IT company. \n\nDid anyone here go through the same thing or similar and is there anything I‚Äôm missing or not understanding in the process? Any advice is good advice at this point",

    "After reading few of posts here about work permit visa process times, I kinda feel hopeless. Looking for a job as a Mech Design Engineer.

From the unlimited job adverts, the answer looks like yes, but yet no one responds back with an interview and they would just say they found a better candidate, but the next day I see the same job advert again and again.\n\nWhy not hire me if you can't find a skillful person locally, let me offer those skills and come to Sweden. But maybe they want to but can't be bothered because of the visa hassle.\n\nWhat are your thoughts? What shall I do, any advice will be highly appreciated.

    "Now or Later? My dual-citizen (US/Sweden) partner has just gotten into a master's program at Stockholm for English literature. We're weighing our options and trying to evaluate the best path forward.\n\nApologies for text wall. This is a sort of update on my [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TillSverige/comments/v4ea6c/how_can_my_partner_and_i_best_prepare_to/).\n\n**Some background**:\n* She has undergraduate degrees in cinema and creative writing, and on/off professional experience in a variety of office jobs. She works part time, 32 hours @ $16.50/hr. \n* I have an undergraduate degree in environmental engineering/water resources and 2 years ongoing experience in the industry. I work full time, remote, $75k/yr salary.\n* She has some language capacity, but would need to put in some serious work to get back to fluency. As a Swedish citizen, she already has a personnummer and an up-to-date Swedish passport.\n* I have minimal language capacity at the moment. I'm only a US citizen.\n\n* Our only debt is $12k in student loans (maximum, $2k minimum depending on how forgiveness works out for the US)\n* We have two fully paid-for cars (nothin fancy), which we'd sell in the event of a move, and ~$26k in savings.\n* She has visited Sweden to see family throughout her life, and has spent over a month there before. I have never been. We are visiting in May, but that's unfortunately after the deadlines for our decision.\n* We have cohabitated/shared finances and insurance for 2 years now, and our relationship couldn't be steadier.\n\nAt the moment, she is deciding between the Stockholm program and a *potentially* partially funded MFA at CU Boulder here in the states. We'd likely be able to avoid extra debt, but we'd have to pay. We hope to move to Sweden at some point, either with this decision or after grad school.\n\nHere's where we could use another set of eyes.\n\n**Our Options, As We See Them**:\n* Stockholm: We both start learning the language ASAP, minimizing possessions here. She goes over for the program, getting set up with banks, an apartment, a job, etc. I stay stateside and focus on minimizing my costs, learning the language, and applying for positions. I go over once I have a decent job opportunity.\n* Boulder: We both start learning the language, with the goal being B2/C1 by the end of her grad schooling. I continue working, she picks up a part-time if the funding from CU falls through. We use those years to prep for moving, building finances and minimizing possessions, and we move when she's done.\n\n**Questions**:\n* Is the master's program any kind of foot in the door for her professionally if she develops language competency by the time she exits?\n* Is she better off getting an MFA here and then trying to break into things, assuming language competency by the point?\n* What level of fluency is the baseline for my industry? I've been told it's relatively minimal, but though I intend to dedicatedly pursue it, I'm worried I'll be basically unhireable without at least B2/C1. For me, this is the highest priority.\n* Long shot, but any estimate on how long it'd take me to find a position? Would likely be looking at multinational engineering consulting firms.\n* Are there other resources we might be overlooking for her transition?\n* In your opinion, which path of action is a better idea? Any alternative recommendations?\n\nTL/DR; My partner got into grad school in the US and Stockholm. We wanna move to Sweden eventually--is now the time to pull the trigger?\n\nThank you to any and all who take the time to read/respond!",

    "Changing main applicant on active work permit for extension. Hi, me and my wife been in Sweden for almost 4 years.

    "UK Statutory Credit Report not being admitted by Skatteverket Hello,\n\nMy girlfriend and I (Europeans, not British) moved to Sweden from the UK in September 2022 to start our business here. After a ton of paperwork and many issues, we managed to get the company registered at the end of February 2023.\n\nWhen we applied for F-Tax, Skatteverket sent us a letter asking us to prove that we don't have any debts in the UK. We immediately requested a Statutory Credit Report from Equifax, since in the UK, like in many other countries, the government doesn't issue credit reports. However, the lady from Skatteverket says that the Statutory Credit Report is invalid and must come from HMRC.

    "Boss seems to be unhappy that my husband got sick 2 times since started working I‚Äôm asking this for my husband. He has been working at a company that has stores everywhere in Sweden about 4 years (since he was a student but in another city) Everything was good until they got a new manager who wanted to have only young and energetic people. My husband was young but not energetic enough because he was depressed and just lost one of his best friends. The manager nipped picking him on everything even when he yawned in a warehouse at 7 in the morning. Many people had quit because the manager didn‚Äôt give them enough hours. They were basically forced to quit. I told my husband that he should report this to the headquarter but he didn‚Äôt have energy to do it.\n\nWe moved to another city not long after and two months ago he started working at the same company again. The previous manager said she could be a reference person for him and she didn‚Äôt give him a good reference when she talked to another manager. The new manager decided to give my husband a chance but he would be on trial period. \n\nAround two weeks ago my husband got food poisoning and it was really bad to the point that 1177 told us that he needed to go to the ER if he didn‚Äôt feel better in an hour. After that he had to stay home for a week. I had it before too so I know that it will take like a week or more for your body to recover. After that he went back to work and this last Saturday he got a flu which probably from me since I had been sick for a week before. \n\nHe called in at work and his boss said ‚ÄúThis is a second time you got sick‚Äù It kinda threw him off. He was confused because it‚Äôs normal to stay home when you are sick. If you go to work they will tell you to go home because it‚Äôs contagious. \n\nI told my husband that he might want to look for a new job in case he doesn‚Äôt pass the trial period. He is a union member and I will make sure that he will apply for Akassa tonight. I‚Äôm a bit angry because I had experienced this myself before last year when I was really sick and the boss didn‚Äôt believe me. And now my husband feels really down because he knows that the manager is bias and she probably believes whatever the previous manager had told her before. \n\nI want to ask if there is anything we should know and prepare about what might come up in the future? I know that union can help him but I want to have some advice in case I overlook something. \n\nPs. My husband is a type of person who goes to work without complaining even he doesn‚Äôt like it.

    "Are these normal company issues in Sweden or is it just mine? I‚Äôm trying to gauge whether my company is just bad or whether this is normal in Sweden, sorry if the title isn‚Äôt good, I tried my best haha.  \n\nI started at my company over a year ago after moving here in December 2021. I moved as a low intermediate/high junior level software developer who my previous manager was very impressed with. I could comfortably do most work with little input and when I did need input, I knew what they were talking about and could go off and do the work needed. Documentation was plenty and work was well broken down, and language used was very comparable to ELI5. Due to a combination or these things, I felt confident in my abilities and I knew my strengths and weaknesses. Overall I was very satisfied with my last company. \n\nI moved to a growing start up into a more junior role and I immediately started to struggle. The code was a mess and there was very little documentation, and these problems persist today. People know how to do their work with some struggle though, however, I still struggle much more intensely with the work. Many days I cry (I work from home) because I feel useless and like I can‚Äôt do anything. I feel like I have no guidance and the guidance I do have is just people telling me what to do or just saying that they don‚Äôt know either, or not explaining things well. I feel like I‚Äôve regressed in my abilities because I feel confused all the time. I have no confidence or energy to go through the interview process with other companies, so although I am applying to other jobs, I dread actually getting the interview, as dumb as that sounds. \n\nWhy I want to know if it‚Äôs Sweden-related is because it seems that the senior engineers don‚Äôt really do anything that senior engineers did in my last job. Like I said, their guidance isn‚Äôt great and they don‚Äôt tend to make any sort of engineering decisions. I realise that this is partly upper management, but I‚Äôm constantly doing mid and sometimes senior level work because they don‚Äôt want to do the bigger tickets or they haven‚Äôt broken things down. I know the hierarchy is different for most companies compared to the rest of the world, is this what they mean by that? Aka if I *do* eventually get into another company, will these problems follow me?\n\nSorry if this seems negative. I love my life here in Sweden, but work has made me suicidal it‚Äôs gotten so bad. I‚Äôm hoping it‚Äôs just the company because if this is similar in other companies then I might have to move back.\n\nEDIT: Thanks for everyone‚Äôs input, I‚Äôll continue to look for another job! \n\nOne thing that‚Äôs cropped up a couple of times is some people saying that it‚Äôs my fault for putting in the work for learning how to do things. I have made multiple projects of my own in my spare time with no issues, had no problems with my last company etc. The issue with this codebase is that not even the senior devs understand it (they complain about it a lot), but they don‚Äôt have the time to refine it and have the experience to know enough about it to work on it. We have a 14 year old monolith that has 100s of thousands of lines of code along with 100s of services (most people who worked on the spaghetti code have now left), and most of these also have tens of thousands of lines of code, a lot of which have little to no documentation. I‚Äôve gotten to the point where I‚Äôm comfortable enough with the frontend code (which is where I work 70-80% of the time), but feel totally overwhelmed with the backend.",

    "Question about sambo visa/permit (EU citizen looking to help US partner move here) Hi there!\n\nI've been living in Sweden as an EU Citizen for over 3 years now. I've been working the entire time here, and as I understand it I have right of residence in Sweden as a result of being an EU citizen.\n\nI have been in long distance relationship with someone for over 6 years now, and we have made multiple visits to each other over the years. I used to live in Australia (where I was born) and she lives in the US. I've been looking into the possibility of finally closing the gap and having her live here with me, and the most reasonable way seems to be through her applying for a sambo visa.\n\nNow what is confusing to me, is that from what I can tell on the migrationsverket website, it seems to say that the partner she is applying to move and live with needs to either be a Swedish citizen or have right of permanent residence. I could be wrong, but from what I understand as an EU citizen I do not have \"right of permanent residence\" until I have lived here for 5 years. Is that correct?

    "Got myself confused about loan/mortgage/brf shares for apartment. I thought I had a good understanding of the whole process and details. But I seem to have gotten myself all confused by reading further. \n\nMy plan: buy a small apartment while finishing my degree. I (luckily) have enough for 50% deposit.

    "Sending items from Spain to Sweden Hi everyone! My apologies if this has been posted already, or if the post contents themselves do not fit in this specific subreddit. First time posting here and on Reddit in general btw.\nI moved to Sweden with my sambo almost two years ago already, and have delayed having a bunch of rather heavy boxes being sent from my home country, Spain, to Sweden, until my sambo and I could both settle down properly in a house. Now that that‚Äôs done, I wish to liberate my parents from the annoyance of having about three boxes full of books (unfortunately for the couriers and for them, I read a lot) taking up space at home, but am struggling finding a reputable, reliable and not prohibitively expensive shipping service that will send my books from Spain to Sweden, ideally door to door. \nI don‚Äôt mind having to wait longer to receive my books here in Sweden, as I am in no particular hurry therefore express shipping isn‚Äôt necessary. I‚Äôve used student shipping companies from the UK to Spain before while doing my masters, thus I am only familiar with those kinds of services. I reckon something within the EU will be a bit easier, but most sites tend to offer ‚Äúholiday luggage shipment‚Äù or look a bit sketchy. I‚Äôd love to know if any of you have any sort of experience shipping heavy boxes within Europe, with not particularly fragile contents (although I do have some old paperbacks from the 1940s in my book collection I want to bring over) as economically as possible.\nThanks in advance!",

    "Trapped between SAS and SEB in a money claim. Advice wanted. TLDR:\nSAS owes me 5000 sek. SAS claims they sent a transfer to an SEB account that is  closed. SEB claims that they don‚Äôt have the money. Both of them are blaming the other side and the issue is stalled.  Any advice on how I could solve this? \n\nDetailed description:\nSAS owes me compensation for a canceled flight. I applied for compensation on their page and it was granted. At that point in time I had an account with SEB which I was about to close. I closed the account on the 2022-09-29. After a while I noticed that the money from SAS never came and I inquired with them. After a long back and forth they told me that the money was sent to my SEB bank account 2022-09-30 (one day after I closed my account). Now, I contacted SEB who clarified to me that if they sent the money to a closed account the money should be returned to SAS. I went with this information to SAS and they say that the money never came back and that I should inquire further with SEB. SEB of course sticks to their story and I am in a deadlock.\n\nNow, I have in email the exchanges described above and I am wondering if there is an institution in Sweden that can solve this type of deadlock between companies when a consumer is involved. Who would you recommend to contact? Would it make sense to contact a lawyer? \n\nEDIT (more info):\nSAS provided papers of the transfer which I then showed to SEB. They claim that this HAS to be rejected and that the rejection notice should be on the SAS system as they (SEB) don‚Äôt have the money.

We're waiting for his first permit still.\n\nI have read on Reddit that I must first get PUT, when we renew our temporary permits, before my child can get his PUT and the same goes with citizenship. This came as a surprise because when I talked to MV on the phone, they said it was obtained independent of me having PUT or Citizenship. Maybe it was a miscommunication.\n\nSo if MV refuses my request for PUT when my five year permit is up for renewal in 2027, and they instead renew it as another 5 year permit, then will we have to wait again (til 2032?) then to apply for me or my child's PUT/Citizenship? That just seems crazy. Especially since he qualifies for PUT at 3 years and citizenship at 5 years.\n\nIs only employment income from inside Sweden counted for the maintenance requirement (self-support) or is that worldwide income?

Long story, but I got an interesting opportunity for the second job and am selling this company in a couple of years, so I am investing some hours per week into it.

Things that you would have done differently? Things you would do the same if you had to go through it again?

If it helps we're going to live in a Stockholm suburb and we're both M29. \n\nHere's our plan so far: \n\n- I make enough to support us both and while financial independence is important, step one is SFI or Folkuniversitetet if SFI is not up his street.\n\n- Each month we will pay all our necessary bills - rent, power, travel card, food, phone plans etc - and then we split the rest between us, essentially giving us both an allowance. \n\n- We've agreed that we'll go on a date at least once a month, not because we need an itinerary for our whole life but because we want to make sure we spend time together outside of everyday cooking, chores, grocery shopping etc. This is also a way to make sure we always keep talking about how things are going between us.\n\n- We have a number of international companies lined up for when he's ready to look for work that match his work history. \n\n- I've practised various recipes that I know he likes, like chicken tortilla soup, those biscuits you guys make, and chili dogs. \n\n- We have a plan for social activities: we want to take dance classes together, I've found a Swedish/American social club we can join and we've found a dog that he will dogsit a few days a week because he's leaving all his animals behind and dogs make him happy. This will also give him a bit of a project outside of SFI and because he'll be meeting the dog's owner in various places to pick up/return the dog he'll get to practice different commute routes. \n\n- All my family and friends are beyond supportive and can't wait to include him in everything. I have talked to them about involving him as much as they can by speaking English even when they're not talking directly to him, but to also let him practice his Swedish when he wants to. \n\nOkay, this post is already super long and the more I write the more I wonder if we're overthrowing everything, but I do think planning is the key.

    "Tips, recommendations, advice Hi everyone! I (26f) am visiting Sweden for two months this May and June, and I am looking for your best tips, recommendations, and advice for traveling alone in Sweden. \n\nI am looking for tips for traveling safely as a single woman, anything that could make my travels more efficient, as well as general etiquette for interacting with Swedes!\n\nI will be staying predominantly in Uppsala, but will also be visiting Stockholm, Link√∂ping, Norrk√∂ping, Malm√∂, G√∂teborg, Eskilstuna, and Kiruna for the Ice Hotel! I will also be hopping over to K√∂penhamn for a few days.\n\nI am learning Swedish and would love to have opportunities to speak with people, but I also respect that striking up conversations with strangers beyond asking for directions may not be appropriate/wanted.

    "Need advice on Staying 90+ days in Sweden I am an undergraduate student in Canada and I recently got an opprotunity to go to sweden and do research for 4 months in the summer. The problem is getting Schengen Visa would only allow me to stay there for 90 days. I know that I can apply for Residence Permit (which would allow me to stay more than 90 days) but the estimated processing time is four months which means it might not be ready by the time I need to travel. I know it was stupid of me to not check the processing times and file the permit early.   \nSo I was thinking of just applying for the Schengen Visa and then travel to Sweden. While I am in Sweden, I plan to apply for the residence permit there. Is this legal? Am I breaking any kind of rules? Should I give up on this plan and just stay for only 90 days in Sweden instead?

    "Question about moving to Sweden Hej, sorry for formatting and this being all over the place. I‚Äôm on mobile and am pretty sleep deprived. I‚Äôm a US citizen in my junior year of high school.

    "Technigo bootcamp reviews? opinions? reputation in Sweden?  Hey everyone!  \nI  was looking into the various courses /bachelor degrees etc that Sweden  has to offer (in English) and I came across a Bootcamp from a company  called Tech Nigo. I am highly interested in applying and hopefully going  through with it. I have found nothing but really good reviews about it  and also people claiming ( as well as the company themselves) that you  have a really high possibility to land a job once you finish the  bootcamp. (I know in this field (read below) you have a big chance  regardless but the promise and claims of past students that with this  course you can land a good job or it at least provides the contacts to  do so is really tempting i'm not going to lie)\n\nIt  still is a lot of money to invest in a bootcamp so before doing so I  wanted to know if anyone knows something or can give me some  opinions/information/ideas  as to how this place and their \"students\"   are seen in Sweden? Does it have a good reputation for companies and  recruiters ?\n\nThis is because I am  looking forward to moving to Sweden in a few years and, as I am forming  myself as a web developer/full stack developer, which I've been doing  with free courses online and practice, I wanted to enroll in something  that could bring me not only more knowledge and education but also a  certification or job opportunities /contacts in Sweden. I was going to  enroll in an IBM coursera course which is probably 10 times cheaper but  finding this course on a Swedish company with all the job opportunities  it claims to give made think that It may be better for me and my plans.\n\nI dont know any Swedish atm  but will be learning and enrolling in Swedish courses for sure in the near future.\n\nAny help /insights are highly appreciated!\n\nThank you :D",

    "Work permit with Family application questions Hello!!\n\nI have a few questions about the work permit application when you will be traveling with family.\n\nI work in IT for a company that hasn't made any work permits before, I have worked for them for a year and a half in my country of origin (Mexico) because I was planning a wedding before the offer, so they had no problem hiring me and working remotely and then check the permit thing. \n\nThe issue is... I'm married now, so I want to start my application with my now husband. I have read that I can upload my marriage certificate at the same time as uploading my documents to apply as a family, but my employer is not so sure and is saying that we should make my application, and after I get it I can apply for my husband, but we want to travel together and have heard of the enormous waiting times, so probably if we do that I will have to emigrate, and he will be left behind until his decision has been made.\n\n1-Is it possible to apply at the same time? \n\n2- As I've been in the company for more than a year, they won't include any probation period in my new contract, my understanding is that my permit will be for 2 years, does that mean that my husband will have a residence permit with a work permit automatically?  Or he will receive it at a different time? Or do we have to apply for his work permit?\n\n3- Once we arrive, do we make the application for the personnummer as a family, so he can have his at the same time as me? Or does that work different?\n\n4- Husband also work in IT, if he finds a job, would be better for him to get a work permit or stay in mine forever? \n\nReason I'm asking is that, it clearly says that we can apply as a family at the same time of my application for the work permit in one line in the migration page, but my employer understands different from me, and since she is Swedish I am starting to doubt myself and I don't know who else to ask.\n\nThis is that it says :\n\n### If your family will accom¬≠pany you and you are applying for them at the same time, you will also be required to submit the following: \n\n* copies of marriage certificates or the equivalent (applies to married couples or registered partners)\n\nthis can be found in here: [https://www.migrationsverket.se/English/Private-individuals/Working-in-Sweden/Employed/How-to-apply.html](https://www.migrationsverket.se/English/Private-individuals/Working-in-Sweden/Employed/How-to-apply.html)\n\nIf anyone has any experience bringing their family to Sweden with them, I would love to read your comments!

And well, he was not lucky with the case officer. Long story short: easy case, 5 years working in the same company. After sending all the documentation, she was sending him letters about missing documents just by copy-pasting the information on MV webpage.

Yesterday he received a letter that he had to submit one last paper, with a deadline of 16th March (and sent less than 1 week ago).

    "contingency moving plans with university applications and different options As university deadlines for masters students is at the end of the month, I've been thinking about alternative pathways for my upcoming mood if the worst happens (this is buoyed by what seems to be fairly low acceptance rates into swedish university programs) and I don't get in at one of my choices. For recap, I'm a 25YO EU citizen (living in the UK for the last 23 years) with a Bachelors in a joint honour (two different fields, maths &amp; sports sci). I don't have any fast commitments here (no partner/pets/many posessions), and have plans to leave my menial job in August for moving mid month (thats in place if I do get a university spot or not for the move).  My swedish is an enigma, because I can hold fluent conversations in it, but sometimes I feel very well versed in it, others like I started a few months ago. I have swedish friends here and over in Sweden and they're able to talk normally with me (I also read Swedish novels with a few breaks to add vocabulary to my little personal book), although I'm worried I'll do badly if I do any swedish competency test here, since they often are too polite to pick up on any non large mistakes I make.  With regards to profession, my current job is in administration but its just a general job, I'm not particularly fussed with the other job I get, just that I can be available for playing/reffing tbh. \n\nWhile I would probably prefer to move to my two university places I've picked as my top two ( √ñrebro &amp; Norrk√∂ping), I'm not fussed about moving away from said places, although I do need to move to somewhere thats close to ice hockey &amp; bandy (the former I ref at a decent level here and do for money which may take a while till I get a PN which is limited to when I can find an eligible job), and the latter is what I'm currently playing for the national side here.).  This will involve car usage so thats another wrinkle.\n\n With regards to the logistics of moving, I know as an EU jobseeker (assuming I don't get my desired masters positions), I have 6 months to find work,and I currently have about ¬£7000 (c. 88000Kr) and intend to have by august about ¬£14000 available (so 166000SEK) not including some other savings.  I also have the messy business of getting Skatteverket to accept a GHIC for the UK. \n\nKnowing all this, what would be my best bet for moving?  I'm worried the job front since I don't have a crap ton of experience and my Swedish is good but I always find ways it could be better.",

    "PSA for people moving to Sweden to live with a loved one.

    "I want to rant about SFI (Swedish for invandrare) I have been living in Sweden for 6 years now. My Swedish level is around first grader but I know a lot if it is related to my work. I went to SFI first time when I newly moved to Sweden. The teacher was really weird. I studied in B class really hard. According to the teacher I did not pass the test and she refused to show me the result. So I decided to quit and focus on my career instead. Three years after that I decided to give another try. I worked full time so I could only study in an evening. I had to be present in the class but there was no classroom. We sat in a library and studied by ourselves. Most of my classmate were nice and well educated. Everyone had goals and studied really hard. Unfortunately my father fell ill . I was not allowed to miss class longer than 2 weeks but I went back to see my father and attended to his funeral anyway. When I came back they said I had to wait in a queue again so that was the second time I gave up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThird time is a charm as they say. It was chaotic. I started SFI again after I got laid off and oh man...that class was so entertaining. We had to study online because of Covid. The teacher treated us like we were in a kindergarten. If you can imagine how people talk to kids. She talked to us that way. All my classmates did not listen to the teacher at all so the teacher always screamed and told us to turn off our microphones. I almost gave up again but I made it. I passed the test and moved to C class. The teacher was incredibly awesome. Always straight the point . All my classmates were incredibly nice and know what to do during the lectures and most importantly they respected the teacher. BUT I had to quit again because I was receiving unemployment benefit and they only allowed me to study for 20 weeks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA year and a half later. Here I am starting SFI again in a new city, Stockholm. Now it is different for me because I actually have goal. I want to study KOMVUX (education for adults) later so I study hard everyday. And of course the class was entertaining. I was in the evening class in the beginning. There were 50 students there and 80% of them did not give a damn about study. They barely showed up. BUT when they showed up...They talked all the time. No respect for the teacher or whatsoever. One of the students whom came from Afghanistan went around and ask if anyone could help him bring people from his homeland. And one of the students told him that he could help but he would not do it for free and it will cost a lot of money. Like wtf? I moved to a morning class instead and it is worse. Now 95% of the students do not care about study. They talk all the time. They use their phones during the class. They walk out from the classroom constantly. When the teacher ask them to be quiet they will talk back to her. There was one day that we had to work on an assignment and none of them did it. I even asked them if they did not want to study because I lost my patience at that point. I could not concentrate. One of the loudest ones said sorry but the other one said back to me loudly \"I will not stress myself\" and continued talking with others. So I became \"a stressed one\" lol\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is a huge culture shock experience for me. I am asian. Most of us study hard and we respect teachers. It makes me wonder how do education systems in their countries work? How do the teachers make their students listen? Do they have to yell all the time? Most of the students are from Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Ukraine, Iraq and Thailand. There are more too but I do not remember. I feel so bad for the teachers. No one do homework. Some even try to cheat when we have small tests.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you so much for letting me rant.",

Hi, I've been on a 6-month temporary full-time employment contract (visstidsanst√§llning) for 5.5 months and the HR of my employer informed me last week they are offering me an extension for another 6 months. \n\nMy question is, is it normal (instead of offering a tillsvidareanst√§llning after 6 months)? \nI also read that if one is employed for 360 days by the same employer the contract is supposed to convert to a tillsvidareanst√§llning, is this automatically mandated by law or can the employer somehow choose not to renew the contract or offer yet another temporary contract after my second 6-month period (i.e. when I have been employed for 12 months)?\n\nAnd any reason why a second temporary contract is offered if it will turn into a permanent one after 360 days anyway?\n\nMostly concerned because I'm supposed to apply for PUT in September after 4 years of sambo permit.

    "Earning 50k sek vs 48k sek a month and tax consequences. I'm wondering if it would be better to earn 48k or 50k salary. If it's 50k one would be over the threshold for 51% skat right? And at 48k wouldn't you be just under? Then if you have a promotion while earning 48k, do they have to bump your salary up a lot to compensate for the loss in taxes caused by passing the threshold?

    "American with a Bachelors in psychology. What do I do? Hej \n\nI know the title sounds dumb. Sorry about that.\n\nI'm at an impasse and need ideas. I'd love to move to Sweden. My great-grandmother was from Stockholm, and she brought over a ton of stuff. I've grown up with a lot of Swedish things and some traditions. It's hard to explain, but Sweden is important to me.\n\nMy problem is that I started studying psychology before I realized I wanted to move to Sweden. If I had the idea earlier, I would have been a business major or something. I got my Bachelors in psychology, so my original plan was to get my masters there, but I wouldn't mind doing the Psykologprogrammet from the start.\n\nWhile I was studying in Sweden for a few weeks, I actually had a professor who had a masters in psychology and didn't speak any Swedish, but taught classes in English. Had his personnummer and everything. I wouldn't mind that either. \n\nHonestly, I wouldn't even mind an office job or a store clerk if it meant living there. \n\nI'm more than willing to learn Swedish, but the classes are expensive, and I'm not sure if I have a chance even if my Swedish was good enough. I mean, my grades were excellent, I'm a member of an international scholarship opportunity group and a member of an international honors society for psychology, but I'm not a native Swede and I'm starting to feel down. \n\nWhat if my Swedish isn't good enough by the time I graduate the Psykologprogrammet, if I go down that path? What if I can't get a job? I can get FAFSA at my dream universities, and I can accept the fact that I may need further loans. \n\nWhat if I can't find an apartment? I don't want to leave my cat behind, but I know that apartment waiting lists are super long. And what if I find an apartment that accepts cats, can afford it, but can't make friends because I don't live in dorms? There's no way I'm leaving my cat behind for the entirety of the Psykologprogrammet. If I go the masters route, I can do that, though I'd prefer to have her with me.\n\nNot to mention, they don't have my specific ADHD meds in Sweden, and it might take a long time to get any meds at all. If I find ones there that work for me, what if I can't get them in time and I struggle in school.\n\nEtc etc etc\n\nIt all feels impossible.\n\nI don't know, I guess I just want some support and advice. I'm sorry for the long post and all of the dumping. I'm just feeling pretty down.",
    "Is buying a 100-year-old house worth it? These wooden, Swedish houses in the country are a dream come true to me.

I am aware that an old, wooden house will require work to be done, but naturally I‚Äôd like to avoid a money pit. This would be my first, own property ever. And I don‚Äôt speak Swedish which makes it harder.\n\nThe one I like is from 1925, has had the new roof, facade, two heat pumps and windows installed. Smells nice of wood inside and in the basement. The bathroom is new as well as household appliances, which are extra added value. There is a big garden. It seems to be in good shape. Some of the walls however are fibreboard covered with old wallpaper which look bad and require renovation. General interior upgrade would be needed.\n\nWhat other questions should I ask the broker?

My company was certified with MV and applied for the Fast Track route. And it still took as long as it did. I honestly cannot imagine how much longer it would've been had I accepted the offer from the smaller company, or if I worked an entirely different profession that wasn't in demand. \n\n\n\n\nI hope this was useful for others who are waiting to hear back from MV for the same application, or for those who are trying to move to Sweden!",

My plan is to get also a certificate on the profession from an institution  because i might know the job but without a certificate I do not feel complete. . \n\nAfter some research i saw that there are few of them where you pay a considerably NOT small amount , and you have the opportunity to learn stuff and give exams on the topic in order to become certified . \n\n\nMy question to you guys is if anyone knows  about the value of these certificates in the labor market . Are they competitive ? Because I'm my home countries the certificates from this kind of institution s are completely trash compared to universities and other high education institutions and I dont want to throw my money for nothing .\n\nThis a link to one of many institutions that are out there\n https://sifu.se/kurser-konferenser/vvs/ventilationsteknik/ventilationsteknik-steg-1/\n\nAnd another one \n\nhttps://www.yhutbildningar.se/utbildning/educations?isDistance=1&amp;q=ventilation\n\n\n Thank you in advance.",

    "First time declaring tax as an employee - how do travel costs work? This is the first year in 3 years that I have to declare my tax as an employee. Previously my company's accountant helped me with it, but since I sold my company, other rules are relevant to me.\n\nOne of the rules I don't fully understand are travel expenses to and from home &lt;-&gt; work. Unfortunately my employee does not give me any travel costs since I work home around 75% of the time and I travel to two office locations in different cities. They told me that I can input some details when declaring tax, but I am not sure how I can proof this and how much money I would get back. I used to work in the Netherlands and it is a law that every employee gets ‚Ç¨0.19 per kilometer tax free, making is much easier and friendlier to actually go to work instead of paying it yourself. I even worked for a company which gave everybody either a 1st class train ticket for 1 year or you could lease a company car (they are VERY cheap in the Netherlands, especially when it was an electric car, I had a Tesla Model S and paid literarily 120 euro per month including charging).\n\nI would say that, when I travel to the office, I would take my car (electric, not sure if that matters when declaring) around 75% of the time and the train 25% of the time. This means that I have some receipts from the train, but not for charging my car.\n\nWhat do I need to declare to get some money back? And how does Skatteverket know that I am not working 100% at the office? It seems like you can be a fraudster quite easily, saying that you go to the office 3 times per week but in reality you go 1 time per month.\n\nMany thanks in advance!",

    "Getting Personnummer (Samordningsnummer) and bank account before signing employment contract Hello, right now I am in contract negotiation phase with a company in Sweden (EU citizen living abroad, had lived there before but left 2 years ago and had PN), yet the requirement is to have declared address and bank account, both in Sweden and personal number. It was stated that in the beginning I can go just with my passport for employment contract, but for remaining two, as I understand, I need PN anyway.\n\nFor me now it is unclear in what order should I solve these three issues? I have found a place to rent, if I go to Skatteverket will I need PN or SN to declare it as my new address? I did the same procedure many years ago but can not remember how it was particularly.\n\nRegarding the bank account I have read that any EU citizen may open basic account in any member state. But do I need PN/SN and declared address beforehand to do it? Which banks I should be looking for?

    "Sweden debt collection agency questions Hej ni alla,\n\n(This post technically shouldn't be here, I am in Sweden already, but this is the kind of sub where users would know the correct answers, so I ask for permission and forgiveness to post this)\n\nI have encountered an issue in life that I cannot solve myself and I need some advice. I'll try to keep the details to a minimum for doxxing purposes, but to a maximum for answer quality. \n\nI got a phone operator monthly bill sent to a collections agency. I was never offered an oppprtunity to pay it, despite having agreed in person (at the shop) at a payment method before, so I think it has been sent there illegitimately, and would prefer to dispute/contest it. \n\nNow the difficult part is that I am a Ukrainian refugee with no knowledge of any parts of the system - and no money to pay either company's additional fees. Furthermore, my address has recently changed, but neither the phone operator nor the collections agency know, so I didn't even receive the \"you owe us money, pay here or else\" bill. \n\nI'd email the collections agency about this, see how we can arrive to an accord, but apparently they don't communicate by email at all. I'd call them, but all of the above means my phone service is discontinued. I'd engage with the online verified customer service thing, but I can't have Mobile BankID because it requires a Swedish tax number. They don't have an office around my location either. To sum up, there's no way to contact them. \n\nI looked some info up on their website and they mention only communicating with me at my, quote, \"address as specified with the Swedish Tax Agency\". I don't have one as I'm not registered with the Swedish Tax Agency (we can, but don't have to, get a Personnummer at Skatteverket, and I didn't), and their address and phone number for me are both wrong. The system might not be accounting for this - Ukrainian refugees only became a thing in 2022. \n\nSo the questions I wanted to ask are: \n\n- Starting with my situation, how do I dispute a bill with the collections agency?\n- What are the consequences if I don't do anything and wait for the problem to disappear? What if I'm certain I won't need to do anything that checks my credit score, so I don't care about it?\n- What if I don't pay anything and leave Sweden altogether - can the consequences spill over to other EU countries? What if I eventually return to Sweden long after?\n- If going with \"talk it out\" or \"pay your bill\" solutions, how do I even contact the agency?",
    "Sole traders and limited companies - pension savings, tax advantages (rookie questions) According to verksamt, both sole traders (enskild firma) and those who run a limited company (aktiebolag) may deduct private pension savings amounting to up to 35 % of their salary. To make this deduction, they must be saving for their retirement in a pension insurance or pension savings account. Does anyone know:\n\n1. if it can be done retrospectively (for 2022) despite transferring the money to a pension savings account in early 2023, before submitting the tax declaration?\n2. if the savings are equally big for sole traders and those with a limited company? At verksamt, they write \"As usual, your company pays employer contributions on the entire salary, but you avoid paying income tax on the part that corresponds to the deduction, because the savings are deducted on your tax return\" - isn't it the same for sole traders?\n3. and a related question on sole traders vs limited companies.

    "Stuck in a Silly Bureaucratic Conundrum I've got a fun puzzle for you guys. TL;DR at the bottom. I'm an American citizen, and I've been living in Finland for the last 3 years as a resident, I got my residency permit through studying and I am just finishing up my degree this year. \n\nI now plan on starting a NEW degree in Sweden, but this has some speed bumps. To apply to the school I wish to go to, I need to get my upper secondary education certificate (HS diploma) verified by UHR, the Swedish council for higher education. The problem is that the criteria to get your certificate verified is to be an EU citizen, an EU permanent resident, or to have already sent in an application for Swedish residence. \n\nI am only an extended resident in the EU, not a permanent one. I have gone through the entire application process for applying for a residency permit in Sweden, but they require an acceptance letter by the school you will attend, the very school that I need a pending residency permit to verify my diploma to apply to. \n\nIt's very confusing. And yes, the school allows non-EU students, as long as you are a Nordic resident, which I am. I've talked with them about it and they are alright with my situation.\n\nI'm almost tempted to submit a blank document on my residency application just so I can show UHR that I have submitted an application so that I can apply for my diploma to be verified so that I can apply to this school so that I can apply for residency again. It can't get much more complicated than that.\n\nLet me know if you have any advice or ideas how go get out of this conundrum. \n\nTL;DR: University application requires UHR verification, UHR verification requires residence application, residence application requires acceptance letter.

Currently waiting for my PN, so I'll be covered under the country's healthcare.\n\nThe question: will they have any way of knowing I canceled my private plan? Or will this come back to bite me? I don't see how. I really don't want this particular plan and will most likely be covered under Sweden soon anyway.\n\nTack!",

    "Working in Denmark with Swedish contract Hej!\n\nI've been living for quite some time in Sweden and I've worked in Denmark in the past but with a Danish contract.\n\nNow, I'm being head hunted for a quite interesting position in Denmark. I got surprised when the recruiter explained that the contract would be a Swedish one even though the office would be in Denmark.\n\nSo my questions are: is this a common practice? Is there a catch or something specific to look for or think about in such cases?\n\nI understand it would be easier for me in terms of taxes or banking but I also suspect it is likely to mean a lower salary too.\n\nThanks!",

I'm going to finish studying later this year and I want to move to Sweden for 1 or 2 years to get to know the country and culture more.\nThe catch is that I would like to keep working for my current employer here in Germany but remotly.

I got this subreddit recommended so I hope someone can give me any advice here.\n\nAfter I already explained my situation to the swedish tax agency I only got a short answer that I would just count as self-sufficient since I earn my money outside of Sweden and I would have to show them my contract and paychecks to proof that I earn enough money to be self-sufficient. But in other forums people said that my plan is only possible if I either do the work as a freelancer for my company and send them an invoice every month or to handle everything through some service like on remote.com, even tho I'm pretty sure this kind of service wouldnt be an option for my employer.\n\nMaybe someome can help me and share some sources or information that help me to figure out all the options I have.

    "What's the optimal way to transition from the UK to the Swedish education system for 15 years old? After living in the UK for ten years, my wife and I are considering relocation to Sweden. We are both Latvian/EU citizens working in IT, and finding a job without knowing Swedish at a decent level should be possible. We understand the importance of the Swedish language and plan to learn it well.\n\nOur primary  concern is education for our daughter, who is 15 (Year 10). If we were staying in the UK, she would finish secondary school (Y10 and Y11), then go to Sixth Form for two years, and then university. She doesn't speak  Swedish yet.\n\nMy question is, at what point relocation to Sweden would be best for her, considering that she wants to continue her education at university?\n\nThe options we see are:\n\n* finish Y10 in the UK and then continue her education in Sweden (moving in 6 months)\n* finish secondary school (Y10 and Y11) in the UK and then continue her education in Sweden (moving in 1.5 years)\n* complete   secondary school and sixth form in the UK and start university in   Sweden (moving in 3.5 years) - least wanted but still an option\n\nThere are pros and cons to every option above.

    "Hanging on This might not be a typical migration story for many but I am seeing more and more similar cases so I thought I would share my story. It is not a story of triumph yet. But I‚Äôll let you be the judge and please let me vent a little but I assure you it is all above board\n\nA little background. I am non EU and I have traveled and lived in many countries and I have been a migrant for half my life. I have over 25 years experience as an IT architect/consultant.I moved to Sweden from Singapore and no I am not Singaporean. Graduated in U.K. and worked in a start up in the U.S. before migrating to singapore and becoming a PR there. the same MNC company I was hired for in Singapore transferred me to Sweden to basically to do the same job but for the Nordic region. I moved my whole family including 4 kids to Sweden. And when I was moving here due to the stress of moving and the stress of managing a rental house and the school district. I had a stroke and left me slightly disabled. I have since recovered and almost back to my normal self. \n\nAfter 3.8 years I was let go due to a restructuring. I tried to find other positions in the company but eventually decided to try out a local start up to see what it is like to work for a local company in the start up scene albeit risky and due to cost contains I was let go again. In my first arbetsbrist(lay off)I got a good substantial pay off because by then I was with the company for 15 years. Then in my second lay off I just got 3 months notice. Which is ok for me. But it all happened right before my pass expires and that I needed to apply for my PR before it expires. And I managed to submit with the help of a immigration lawyer. But I was frantically looking for a job in the mean time. Before the 3 months expires. legally Migrationsverket has published that as long as I have submitted my application and it is being decided I have the right to stay and continue. Yes I have a case number and everything was submitted 2 weeks before the expiry (I read there was a change in the rules for submission but I couldn‚Äôt find it anymore on the web) so it is expired but it is pending a decision. I actually got a job with another local company although quite substantial in size they do not sponsor work permits. They have sent me an offer letter and I have digitally signed it but they then rescinded it because they said they do not handle work permits and require employees to be legal. I have explained to them that I am legal pending a decision but they still refused. I have a personnummer and have some roots here. No I have not bought a house but I have sufficient space for the family and have no debts/kronofogden notices. \n\nSo now I am jobless and my pass is expired and it is hard for me to get hired although I am still trying to see which company will accept me with a pending decision. \n\nI know I have a purpose in Sweden. I just find it difficult on a daily basis. I have always been a fighter and I have a ton of grit. But i doubt myself sometimes. I have one more emergency stash of savings/investments that will be used to get us all home if we really need to leave. I am given myself up to may this year. If I don‚Äôt find any job by then I‚Äôll have to make the difficult decision of going back. But I have struggled so much just to go back now I feel I fought for nothing and my kids have not finished school. I work on a daily basis.\n\nI am doing vikariat at an international school to get some money to try to stretch till after summer so if need be I can change my timeline to sept instead of may and I am also getting some amount from A-kassa and f√∂rs√§kringskassan For unemployment but as of last week I have 260 days left and I have 58 weeks of vikariat weeks left out of 60 as permitted by A-kassa. \n\nI have spoken to arbetsf√∂rmedlingen and it is possible to start a business. So I am also trying that route as well. \n\nFriends are encouraging and tells me to keep hanging on. But sometimes friends are bias. \n\nOthers have asked me why I am still here and on days like these when a student in school disrespects you and try to undermine me and my desire to impart knowledge and education for them I question myself why I am still here.  I am wondering if I have made a mistake to move here and kept fighting to stay. Am I fooling myself?\n\nI am in my final stages of SFI-D and I have got my nationell prov end of the month. Sometimes issues like these are making me unsure of myself. And when I pass, I am also considering to do my SVA gymnasium. And maybe try to change my profession after.

Soon we are going for our first checkup with our son and I wanted to ask if there's anything we should do or be prepared for beforehand.\n\nAlongside mandatory vaccines, our son got few additional ones (that's how it works in Poland - every child must have the basic set but it's recommended to pay for additional ones). I have compared mandatory vaccines and Sweden has the same. Do you know if we will be able to continue extra ones here? We are ready to pay for them but I wonder how it works here. \n\nAlso we have a full documentation from previous doctors but I wonder if there's something I might be surprised with. Has anyone any stories to share that might help us?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks!",

I got panicked and immediately got a lawyer, and since then as you can imagine I have been investigating the reasons of my denial. I noticed that the agent that I applied with really messed everything and gave me wrong information throughout the process and even made my application with missing information. I think my application \"status\" so to say, is completely wrong. They are a very well known consultancy company and thats why I thought it would be reliable to make a fast-track application with them.\n\nNot to give you a headache and occupy your time, I want to get straight into the point. I will be appealing against this decision and I think I have a high chance of obtaining the permit if everything can be proven and accepted by the court. Is it common that people are misinformed and misguieded by their agents/lawyers and get a refusal for their applications? Can I explain and prove to the court that I have been misguided by this agent? Will they show consideration or not?\n\nAppreciate any advices in advance.",

    "I'm looking for help moving as a Self-Employed Business Owner I am currently a self-employed business owner in the US. I've run an entertainment business for about 8 years. Our specialty is pub entertainment (trivia, karaoke, bingo, et al), but about half of my annual business is emceeing and DJing weddings, corporate events, holiday parties, etc. \n\nI'm wanting to move for personal and political reasons, but mostly because all the research I've done has shown Sweden to be one of the happiest countries with some of the highest quality of life. I want that; I want to live a healthier, happier, better life.\n\nMost of my business I can do remotely - I have hosts/entertainers working for me who can do the in-person hosting. These days I mostly just book gigs, handle clients, and write questions.\n\nIdeally, I would like to buy a villa that I can convert to a wedding venue. I've found plenty within an hour or so of decent-sized cities that are within my price range. Even without finding work in Sweden, my residual income would be enough to cover all my living costs. That said, I'd also be happy to get some entertainment contracts in some Swedish bars or pubs and continue working in that field, as well.\n\nUnfortunately I have no contacts in Sweden. I don't know anyone. I don't have contacts for vendors that I could work with as a venue, or pubs that I could potentially entertain at, and I don't know how to make those contacts.\n\nI'm hoping someone here can either give me some guidance on making those connections so I can do the application myself via Migrationsverket, or can recommend a Swedish lawyer that can assist with the immigration. I've spoken with some lawyers in the country already, and they've expressed confidence they can get me in, but the quotes they've given me (for just filling out the necessary paperwork) has ranged from $5,000 SEK to $156,000 SEK, and I simply don't know what's reliable or what to expect.\n\nI appreciate any insight you can offer.\n\nEDIT FOR CLARITY: I am not looking for advice on whether or not I will like Sweden, or should move there. There is not a single point that has been brought up in the comments that I was not already aware of, or that I haven't already considered.\n\nI am asking only for recommendations on reliable immigration lawyers, or for local services that can help connect me with businesses and vendors in the event industry.",

So here I go, about 9 months back I joined a new team within my company and during my half yearly progress check with my manager, he asked me if I have feedback on my colleagues and what areas they can improve.\n\nOn the surface it seems like an innocent question but I felt my manager was looking for dirt on my teammates. To be honest, I am never the one who wishes to engage the management to talk about my coworkers especially if it isn‚Äôt positive feedback. For a fact I have no problem getting along with my teammates and in case there is ever a misunderstanding, I would really like to engage the person one on one and take the conversation offline. I value team trust over management driven resolution unless the person involved has a different preference. Given the labor shortage in Sweden, anything I say about my colleagues will not result in a big decision but I have a feeling it is something that may influence matters like their salary hike or promotion. I can still understand if one or some of my colleagues were really toxic and my feedback would result in a better workplace for everyone but that‚Äôs not the case.\n\nIt is possible my perspective and approach is wrong üòë So I wanted to ask here if this is common at your workplace too?

    "I was scammed trying to rent an apartment in G√∂teborg  \n\nI found the ad from Blocket bostad then met the Swedish person (landlord) face to face on coffee shop. The guy gave me his driving license and I took a photo of it. He shown me his kids and family photos and told me about his vacation trips. He seemed a reasonable guy and the ID photo was matching with him.\n\nSo the apartment was entirely new one but it was under construction. Therefore he did not have the keys as the company will give the keys on February. I was very suspicious and asked him to prove that he owns the right to sublet the apartment called bostadsf√∂rening. He shown some photos and documents about it. It looked very reasonable and I shared it with my Swedish friends. He wanted to sign the contract asap but I said to him that I want to check the apartment first and do a background check with his personnummer. I did the background check and visited the apartment from outside. I read the contract and signed it. The contract was very good prepared as the guy was working as a real estate. I wanted to pay the deposit first via Swish but my limit was not high enough. However I saw on Swish app that his name was matching with the name on ID. Actually I was bit suspicious all the time but I was so unhappy with my current apartment, therefore it felt reasonable to trust him and take the risk. I also checked the residential property from their website and information was matching. \n\nAnyway interestingly this Swedish real estate guy did not break the connection after he got the money via Swedish bank account transfer and his phone still rings and he reads my text messages.\n\nFew days before our appointment for keys delivery, I went to the apartment to see whether the construction is completed. It was ready and the door of the building was open. I entered the building and saw someone else's name for the apartment. I called him directly and he said there must be something wrong and I pay your money back. He said that he transferred the money and sent me the transaction screenshot. It looked so real but the money did not arrive.\n\nSo I went to police and filed it immediately.\n\nLuckily I could keep my current apartment.\n\nIt is a life lesson for me and I still do not get why the Swedish government does let people doing second hand contracts for housing. It is illegal in many countries.\n\nI will wait for first hand contract or use and pay to QASA which I did not know before this incident.",

    "Moving to Sweden and residence card vs permit My spouse (24F) from Denmark and I (23M) from the USA, are looking to finally live in the same country after 7 years of long distance. We legally got married 2 months ago in Denmark but cannot move to Denmark as we don't meet enough of the requirements for family reunification. We've never lived together on paper but have traveled to each other and spent much time in each other's countries. As it stands, she is finishing her studies in Denmark and planning to try and work in and move to Sweden in August (which we've also heard finding a place to stay is difficult). We've poured over [migrationsverket.se](https://www.migrationsverket.se) as well as this subreddit and facebook groups in order to prepare. Our biggest disagreement over what we've read is the difference between the residence permit and residence card and the article in question is [this page](https://www.migrationsverket.se/English/Private-individuals/EU-EEA-citizens-and-long-term-residents/Nordic-citizen/Permits-for-family-members/Residence-card-in-accordance-with-EU-and-EEA-rules.html) on the website. She is confident that once she finds a place to stay and finds a job we will immediately begin to file for me to get a residence card and I can move to her immediately and the process won't take more than a few months at most. I am more skeptical and can't believe it would be that easy considering all the stories I've been reading on here even with reuniting with Swedish citizens, let alone a Danish citizen. I can't see anything absolutely convincing me that the residence card route won't work so I can't help but feel I am missing something. That is why I humbly come to this community to ask for any insights you may have. \n\n1. Will my Danish spouse immediately be granted residency after registering for a personnummer? \n2. And as for me, I understand the residence card is not as strong as a permit in the way of health insurance, but are there any other key differences? \n3.

    "I'm in really rough shape and I need help. Do you have any ideas on what I should do? Hi Everyone, \n\nI posted before and got some really helpful advice. I'm hoping someone out there can give me some guidance again. \n\nI moved to Lund, Sweden last summer with my wife. I began to work, and in the beginning of December, I abruptly became severely ill. My symptoms are debilitating and disabling. In short, I have:\n\n* Severe, 24/7 vertigo that keeps me on the sofa or in bed most of the time\n* Brain Fog, and difficulty thinking, remembering, concentrating, and using my limited Swedish skills. I feel like my brain is at 20% operating capacity.\n* Strong intolerance to medium and loud sounds, screens, lights, visual motion, and visually complicated patterns and environments.  Being in these kinds of environments makes my brain \"shut off\" - it's very hard to describe.\n* Awful panic attacks and anxiety (usually about the constant vertigo)\n* Fatigue\n* Nausea, Lack of Appetite\n\nThese symptoms have made it very hard to do anything - I have been out of work for 2 months, and have spent almost all of my time in a dark, quiet bedroom. Going to the doctor has been an extreme challenge - I would be a goner if it weren't for my incredible wife. \n\nI have been tested and imaged by many smart people over the last two months. And, the results have all been normal, despite feeling like half of my brain is missing. A few doctors have suggested that my condition was psychological. At first, I resisted this idea, because it sounded absurd. But, I found this [YouTube Channel](https://youtu.be/4QDFGvHGURc), who describes everything I'm going through with 99% accuracy. I'm convinced that this is what my problem is. \n\nI have turned my attention towards following the recommendations of this YouTube doctor. I am doing my best to resolve my emotional conflicts and acknowledge the psychological conditions that led me to state of dizziness. I feel I have made some minor progress, but I have become stuck and am not sure how to proceed.\n\nI had been seeing a psychologist through the Mindler app (before and during this event), but he has dismissed me because his expertise and the structured course of the app was not suitable for my problem. He recommended to be that I try to find some psychotherapy called \"ISTDP\", which may be well-suited for psychosomatic disorders. He mentioned that I might be able to find student practitioners who are looking for patients at universities to get me help more quickly. \n\nMy questions for you wonderful people:\n\n* Do you have any experience in getting a psychotherapist? Particularly, one who speaks English and can do video calls? How do I approach this? Are these unrealistic things to be looking for? (the healthcare system is very different where I come from.)\n* Do you know anything about psychological teaching universities or how I might get involved with that?\n* Odd question: I have to make lots of phone calls. When I call places (especially clinics), the phone menus are usually in Swedish with little or no English options. I have been doing my best to stumble through what I think the phone options are saying in Swedish, but it has been ugly. I have been trying to connect my phone to a bluetooth speaker and use another phone to use Google Translate to understand what it says, but that has not gone great. Do you have any clever ideas on how I could navigate phone menus? (I can read and write Swedish okay, but listening skills are still awful, even when I was mentally at my best)\n* Do you know about any other resources that might be helpful to me?\n\nOnce more, thank you all for your help. I'm trying to help myself as much as I can, but this has been the most difficult situation in my life.",

    "PSA: How to make Swedish friends for dummies. How to make Swedish friends for dummies. Link to [original post in Swedish](https://www.reddit.com/r/swedishproblems/comments/10xzl0z/comment/j7vuj2u/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3). Posted here as per another user's suggestion.\n\nFirst and foremost, the swede has a few clear levels of acquaintance. Either you're a citizen and should be treated with the appropriate level of Swedish coldness: ~~3 to 10 feet~~ 2 to 9 egyptian royal cubits of distance, avoid sitting close on public transport, avoid eye contact. If your bodies touch it had better be due to a crowded elevator or mosh pit.\n\nThe next level is a peripheral person (Perifera Persson in Swedish.) Here you find people living in your neighborhood, that travel along the same commute or that in some other way appear in your flow of life as recurring background features. These can be engaged with eye contact and should then be greeted with a nod that affirms their existence. Otherwise treat them as citizens.\n\nAbove that you find shallow acquaintances. Among these you'll find work colleagues, people in the same \"f√∂rening\" (e.g. sports clubs, book clubs, hunting crews, political groups, religious congregations and other associations.), childhood friends, classmates, people taking the same course, the human adjacent to you on the croquis course. It is among the shallow acquaintances that swedes look for friends as adults. But it requires tactics and finesse.\n\nIf you feel chemistry with a person in a shallow acquaintance you could try to initiate friendship. In other nations once can invite people over for dinner as a means of getting to know them. This is not done in Sweden, it is weird. Ew. No, the Swedish dance of friendship goes thusly: You begin conversing about the shared context. Perhaps you mention that your boss is an asshat, that Jan-Hilda actually made some descent fika today, that the copier at the university library is broken or that you wonder if your croquis-buddy usually sketches out the birth marks of the models of if the skip that level of detail. If the shallow acquaintance is willing they will respond to this conversational invitation and engage you in conversation. If they are not willing they will (as is thier right as a true Swede) think you are strange talking to people.\n\nIf you manage to talk to each other regularly 3-5 times there might be an opportunity to try to take the acquaintance further. (Important, if you are always the instigator of conversation it might be that you are strange, the potential friend should also initiate conversation. Allowances can be made if they have made it clear that they are socially incompetent or something.) A good suggestion is a fika downtown. There really aren't many other alternatives. Exceptions exist, one is if you notice a surface acquaintance that you've already established a relation of surface acquaintance or peripheral person relationship from another context. Say, for instance, that you meet Rolf-Agnes from the apartment complex on your spinning course, or that you meet your work colleagues at the pub. Then you have free reign to start a conversation with phrases such as \"Oh, imagine seeing you here!\" (\"N√§men, t√§nk att f√• se dig h√§r!\") or \"Oh, I see you come here too!\" (\"Jass√•, du g√•r ocks√• hit ser jag\") or some variant thereof. This is one of the few shortcuts that exist, another shortcut is by claiming a friend that another friend has done the groundwork with. If a new friend is brought into a friend group then you can skip previous steps as a person you've approved of has, through their invitation, approved of this new person's relative reasonability.\n\nAfter a shared fika it might be that you discover other shared contexts in which to engage in relations, or that you make plans for further fika meetings. After doing this a few times (nobody knows for how long,)  it might be fitting to invite the person home for lunch and dinner. With this act you are, unless someone does something deeply upsetting, friends. And you will be friends forever. You have dedicated too many hours of your life to get to know this person and you cannot simply stop your companionship with them, that would be accepting defeat. Hopefully you'v e discovered their problems before the dinner invitation, otherwise you are stuck with them and have to follow them to the mountain cabin despite their deeply disconcerting interests and opinions.\n\nAnother path to friendshiphood is through children. Children are blissfully unaware of the intricacies of Swedish friendshippery and can, completely without shame, approach another child, hand them a ball and say \"I've got super Mario socks\" and with that have an established bond of friendship that many Swedes would require years to cultivate. When children play with other children it is completely within reason to contact the other child's handler and engage them in conversation with phrases such as \"They seem to be playing well together,\" (\"De verkar leka p√• bra,\") or  \"They seem to have found each other,\" (\"De verkar hittat varandra,\") You may then ask for contact information from them using the child as your casus belli. \"We can let you know if we head to this playground again,\" (\"Vi kan ju h√∂ra av oss om vi ska till den h√§r lekplatsen igen,\") or similar.\n\nOr, you simply approach a person and say \"Hey, you seem to like \\[x\\], do you want to talk about \\[x\\] and have some fika?\" This method is deeply un-swedish but does guarantee that whoever assents to this will be as social/desperate/contact-seeking as you yourself.\n\nI said in a comment that Swedish model of friendship is sort of like trying to weasel yourself into another person's life. Through evening classes, children, student unions or board game night we sneak in past another Swede's social walls. The parties, weddings and funerals of friends become trojan horses for relationships.\n\nAnd once you've made a Swedish friend they are often very engaged and generous with everything they have. This dude explains it well methinks: \\[L√§nk!\\]([https://youtu.be/m8jVWawlu5Y](https://youtu.be/m8jVWawlu5Y))  \n\n\n**TL;DR; Find friends in contexts where people do things together by talking about the thing you do together with the people doing the things.**",

    "Migration Minister to look into British deportations As you may know, Sweden had the highest rate of rejections for Brexit applications. In fact, not the highest rate, they flat out rejected more people than any other country. 50% of all Brits told to go home after Brexit were in Sweden. Spain, in contrast, deported 0.\n\nAnyway, the Migration Minister claims she doesn't know why so many Brits were rejected, so anybody going through the appeal process, you may be successful.\n\nTo be honest, a lot of the denying seems to stem more from the fact that Migrationsverket promoted Brexit residency permits far less than other countries, leading some people who had attained permanent residency several years ago to incorrectly believe it didn't apply to them. This could be laid squarely at the feet of said Brits, but other countries didn't seem to have the same issue.\n\nMany countries were sending letters to people's homes. Sweden didn't do such a thing. \n\nBased on Brit in Sweden groups, it seems to be mostly the older folk that didn't believe they needed an extra permit as they had been granted permanent residency and lived in Sweden for a few decades.\n\nStill, nice to know that some people may not be deported after all. Although, she may also come back and say \"screw you\".",

After 3 years I really can't say I'm happy here. It's a great country but people are just mean, even if you speak basic German theyll twist their ear and often don't make it easy for you. Cultural shocks aside, my hobbies very frequently take me to Sweden for camping, windsurfing or kitesurfing, fishing, kayaking, riding my motorcycle offroad or even simple Roadtrips to explore new regions in the car.

    "Question about visiting Sweden? Hello everyone!\n\nI am delighted that Wizz Air has launched a new direct line from my home city to Stockholm Skavsta Airport. I checked it out and typical for a low cost airline, the airport is actually 100 km from Stockholm proper.\n\nSo I wonder if maybe for a first visit to Sweden I can check out the smaller cities first, like Nyk√∂ping and Norrk√∂ping? Would you say they're worth the flight?\n\nI get overwhelmed in larger cities when I visit them first but maybe I can visit Stockholm for few hours, see the main architecture sights and then go to a hotel in Nyk√∂ping or Norrk√∂ping and spend the rest of my days in them?\n\nAlso a side question but if you happen to know where the countryside in Sweden has those rolling green hills I'd love to know. This is the video that made me want to learn Swedish. The countryside is beautiful, Frida sings so poetic here &amp; I was amazed the verb \"to love\" in Swedish sounds similar to my name:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X-aL-LKPbU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X-aL-LKPbU)",

    "I‚Äôm a little intimidated to post this: American inquiring about a student visa in Sweden. I really want to study abroad. I was hoping to major in Communications. I‚Äôm also very passionate about English and I was curious to know if there‚Äôs much of a demand for native English speakers? Initially I had my eyes set on Denmark, but it seems that all of their Bachelors programs are completely in Danish. They do, however, offer Masters programs in English. Oh dear. I was informed that I might have better luck in Sweden trying to pursue my bachelors degree and that they do offer English BA programs. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I love the Danish language and the Swedish language. I genuinely have a strong desire to learn to speak those languages, but I‚Äôm a bit bummed at the prospect of possibly having to study Swedish before I‚Äôd even qualify for a student visa. I have been doing my own research but I feel like I‚Äôm grappling blind here. I have no idea if the sites I pulled up are at all reliable. Any help from locals and expats alike would be greatly appreciated.

Hello everynyan!\n\nBackground: I studied in Ume√• a year ago for a semester (autumn 2021-winter 2022) on a scholarship and really liked it there (Public health).

Specifically programs in the field of epidemiology? I know that Karolinska is the absolute best for medicine in Sweden, but I am afraid that I won't get in!

    "Inconsistencies with CSN and Migrationsverket I moved (28m) to Lule√• from the UK on March 3rd 2018, almost a full two years before Brexit came into effect. Therefore I should, by all rights, be considered a fellow EU member alongside my current Swedish neighbors by the Swedish government according all the information I‚Äôve read. Yet for some reason when I applied for residency last year, I was denied 3 times until finally granted a mere temporary residency. I find this very strange not only because of the aforementioned reason but I also had a Tillsvidare work contract and have been employed in Sweden since I arrived; I should have been granted a permanent residency according to the criteria.\n\nI ran into similar problems when I enrolled into an Yrkesh√∂gskola last year, I was denied CSN because I was considered a non-EU citizen. Even though it explicitly states on the CSN page that if I was living and working in Sweden before January 1st 2021 I would be considered a Swedish citizen according to EU Law. Then to make matters worse, they even denied me the right to CSN as a non-EU citizen in Sweden, because I had to have been working at least 10 hours a week while studying (which is fucking ridiculous in itself). So on Fridays I started going to school 09-17, then working at a bar 18-03 afterwards and 16-03 on Saturdays every week‚Ä¶ They still had the nerve to tell I wasn‚Äôt working enough to qualify for CSN according to EU Law! So I was forced to leave school eventually because I was burning out mentally and financially.\n\nIt‚Äôll be my 5th year this year in Lule√• and will also be 2 years since moving in with my sambo, so I will apply for citizenship this year and take another crack at studying. But I am a little traumatized over how I‚Äôve been treated by Migrationsverket and CSN and quite anxious going into that process again.

Of course when we address people, call for them, ask for them etc, but not all the time as we speak or write to them. When people use my name a lot, I feel like they are creating a sort of intimacy. If it's with someone I don't know well, it seems like they are going out of their way somehow - like they are flirting with me, or trying to sell me something...\n\nPersonally, as a university teacher for Swedish and international students in Sweden, I feel like international students use my first name too much?

My ideal place to go is Malm√∂ but I would happily take anywhere if it meant I could obtain a contract of employment. \n\nThank you for reading this and I hope others can share their opinions with me please let me know if I made any errors too :)",
    "No work permit instructions yet Hi everyone,\n\nOn Tuesday, January 24th, I received an email from my potential employer stating that I should be getting an email from migrationsverket with the instructions on filling out the work permit ‚Äúwithin a couple days‚Äù, but seeing as MV has been the topic of the ‚Äúwaiting game‚Äù for many others, I was wondering if anyone is currently, or has had to wait longer in the recent past.

    "How does healthcare work for non-EU citizen on work permit in Sweden. I'm writing this on behalf of my friend. My friend has been diagnosed with a condition that requires surgery (as recommend by the doctor). He is a non-EU citizen but on work permit in Sweden. He has a p-number\n\nMy query is regarding the use of the public healthcare system.\n\n1. How does the cost of the surgery work in terms of how much he pays and how much is borne by the healthcare system? Or is it not available for non-EU citizens?\n2. If it is available, what would be the procedure to go about the whole thing?\n\nI haven't dealt with the healthcare system here. So any insights would be very helpful. Thanks a lot!\n\nEdit 1: thank you all for all your responses. I will update once his treatment is done so that it can help others as well.",
    "Targeted Mobility Scheme and EURES I could only find [1 post] (https://www.reddit.com/r/copenhagen/comments/rivwf7/future_relocation_from_paris_to_copenhagen/) on reddit about this, not that I expected much since IRL even less people seem to be aware about it, so I decided to make one myself. \n\nI live in Greece, planning on moving to Malm√∂ the following months, and I found out about this service set up by the European Council, [EURES Targeted Mobility Scheme](https://eures.ec.europa.eu/eures-services/eures-targeted-mobility-scheme_en). Supposedly, you can apply for financial support for relocation, language lessons and even interview allowance, as well as other types of help (job search help, job interview preparation etc). But first you need to contact a EURES Advisor. So I sent two different emails, seeking to get in contact with a EURES Advisor that might help me find a job or link me with employers or make some sort of recommendations. To be frank the greek equivalent of this institution doesn't do *any* of that for the unemployed, so I didn't know what to expect. \n\nAnyways, the first email redirected me to the second email after giving me some info. Basically the info was: all the above, a link to search for EURES advisors (where funnily enough my region says there aren't any) and a link to search for jobs with the EURES flag (which signifies the employer is particularly interested in non-Swedish applicants, but apparently that isn't the case in all the search results). Basically, they directed me to the Swedish Public Employment Service where all jobs are posted or the EURES database which also aggregates those entries from there.\n\nThe second email, which supposedly was the right one, basically offered even less information. They advised registering as a job seeker in Malm√∂, physically, bringing my documents. Also they let me know I couldn't apply for TMS after an interview (for financial support to travel, I suppose) neither after moving to Sweden (reiterating the official site information). So basically, they suggest I travel all the way to Malmo, register, and go back? They also suggested I take a look at [the International Citizen Hub in Lund](https://internationalcitizenhub.com/) which I will, but on a first glance doesn't seem to be much of a help. Besides that, they said I should contact companies directly, even without them having a job opening/posting. The message is: find a job yourself and contact us then. *Which is fine, but not what they advertise*.\n\nThis was my experience, for now. I was wondering whether anyone else had something to say about TMS EU.* I don't mean to demean EURES and the TMS people, as I said where I'm from they would do even less.*\n\nI shall include some of the links they gave me, since it might help someone even if they are not EU citizens:\n\n* Malmo Offices [1](https://www.statenssc.se/besok-servicekontor/malmo-rosengard-servicekontor) [2](https://www.statenssc.se/besok-servicekontor/malmo-city-servicekontor) [3](https://www.statenssc.se/besok-servicekontor/malmo-varnhem-servicekontor)\n* [TMS Sweden](https://arbetsformedlingen.se/other-languages/english-engelska/eures-targeted-mobility-scheme)\n* [International CItizen Hub Lund](https://internationalcitizenhub.com/)\n* [Do you want to work in Sweden?](https://arbetsformedlingen.se/other-languages/english-engelska/do-you-want-to-work-in-sweden)\n* [EU Labour Market Information](https://eures.ec.europa.eu/living-and-working/labour-market-information_en)\n* Arbetsf√∂rmedlingen (Swedish Public Employment Service) [site](http://www.ams.se/) \n* A [website to search for companies](https://www.allabolag.se/) to send \"unsolicited applications\" \n* [Europass CV tool](https://europa.eu/europass/en)\n* [JobsinMalmo website](http://www.jobsinmalmo.com/)\n* [Flytta till Sverige](https://www.officialswedishservices.se/)\n* [\"The Local\" Jobs](http://www.thelocal.se/jobs)\n* [EURES Advisers](https://ec.europa.eu/eures/main.jsp?catId=3&amp;acro=eures&amp;lang=en)\n* [EURES Job Postings in Sweden](https://ec.europa.eu/eures/eures-searchengine/page/main?lang=en#/search)\n\nEdit: removed a duplicate link.",

    "My son (3) is very bored at his f√∂rskola, what can we do? He is in a class with 11 other children. Most of them are younger than 2, only 2 kids are a little bit older than 2 but still can't say much more than just very basic words. My son is very bored right now, since he cannot talk with any of the children (he is fluent in French since that is our language, but also speaks a little bit Swedish and understand a lot) and there is a big gap in what he likes to play with and what the other children do. He just doesn't find a connection with the other children, most of them are still even crawling. He does really like the kids in other classes, especially the class with age 4+ who love playing with him as well.\n\nWe asked his teachers what we can do about it, because he clearly doesn't like it at school right now. There are two other classes where they have childeren his age and older and he really likes to play with them. He cannot be transferred to the other classses because 'there are no teachers' (both the other classes have 10 kids and 3 teachers...). When we asked his teachers if he could at least play a couple of hours per week in one of the other classrooms, they told us that there is nobody available to bring him. There is literally one door between the classes, as in you can open it and take him there. \n\nIn addition to his, the teachters are mainly focusing on the younger children which I fully understand since they cannot walk. Because all of this, he is just very bored and dislikes going to school more and more every week. He is mostly just playing by himself, does his own thing and tells us he was bored every day. Also the teachers are not paying any attention to him to learn Swedish, even though they told us that they would at least sit 15 minutes every day with him to read him a Swedish book or to play a game so he could learn Swedish. I happens quite a lot that they just give him an iPad to play games on and I think that is really sad. We get a mail every month of things they are doing and although it is fun, they offer activities maybe once per week. The rest of the time he is just inside playing, watching movies or play outside (he really loves that though). His class doesn't follow some kind of program or offer some kind of learning plan, just playing, eating and sleeping. At home he is helping with cooking, cleaning, building outside, just challenging him on every aspect a young child could be challenged on, but there is clearly a huge gap to what we offer him and what school is doing.\n\nWhat are some of the possibilities we have? Transferring him to another school is something we clearly don't want, but as of now we almost don't see another solution. I hope some of you have any ideas! \n\nThis is a school that is paid by the kommun by the way, is there more personal attention on private schools?",

    "Samordningsnummer questions Hej, I (originally from the US) went to Skatteverket today to try to apply for a personnummer but was told I would be denied if I did so because of the duration of my work permit (6 months under the new changes regarding probationary periods). They had me instead apply for a Samordningsnummer (coordination number), which I was told would allow me to open a bank account. I brought my contract with me to show that I would be automatically converting to a permanent contract after the 6 month probationary period but was told that only works for EU citizens and that I was essentially out of luck in that regard. So now I have to wait at least 6 months to actually apply for a personnummer, since work permit extensions take forever too. I'm not too pleased with this as I've come to realize that everything in this country relies on that personnummer. My question is can the Samordningsnummer be used for some of those things? They only mentioned the bank account thing, but for example to even sign up for a gym membership I need to provide a personnummer, could I just input my Samordningsnummer instead? Or is it somehow formatted differently? Any insight would be appreciated as I'm trying to figure out how to best get through these first 6+ months without that ever essential personnummer. Tack!",

I was very excited to start SFI after waiting some months to get in. The first day of class was difficult to say the least, all of the lessons are taught in only Swedish and it felt like I was the only one there who didn‚Äôt understand. I was told the class was a mix of beginners and intermediate. The first teacher I had was kinda rude to me in a way, it was my first class and she wrote on the board ‚Äúen mening‚Äù, I didn‚Äôt have time to pull out google translate and she asked me directly saying my name out loud in English ‚ÄúDO YOU UNDERSTAND?‚Äù I said, ‚Äúit means a- something, I don‚Äôt know‚Äù she didn‚Äôt translate it and the other students told me. She later made comments to me about how I looked tired in class when I was fully awake giving my full attention so that was confusing. I went home after that a bit disappointed because I didn‚Äôt know everything would be taught in Swedish and it was hard for me to understand anything. I got a book that day and set a goal of studying from the book (m√•l 1) every day for 1 hour and making notes, I also got duolingo to help with vocabulary. I read here on Reddit to not give up on SFI and eventually I will get it. I went again to class and had that same teacher, while teaching she would randomly call my name. I was confused because I was paying attention, she didn‚Äôt do this with anyone else. Luckily that day I made a friend for the first time in five months. We sat together and her Swedish was much better than mine so she would help me translate. We spoke about how we both didn‚Äôt like this teacher as well as how it was weird that she laughed at students who mispronounced Swedish words. The next coming days we got different teachers who were incredibly nice and helpful and would give English translations when I asked them. Then came today, we had that mean teacher again. Throughout the lesson I always payed attention and would occasionally ask my friend for help with translations. The teacher then asked me a question in Swedish that I didn‚Äôt understand. I asked her to repeat what she said but she just scoffed and said ‚ÄúYou speak English, learning Swedish should be easy for you. I don‚Äôt understand, you must only talk to your friend all class.‚Äù I was shocked and replied ‚ÄúI always pay attention in class, I haven‚Äôt even talked to my friend.‚Äù I went home embarrassed and discouraged.

    "How important is educational level to work in Sweden? Hej, I'm moving to Norrbotten by the end of this year/early next year, I have a residency permit on process. Obviously I will be looking for work. My question is, how significant is education to get a work in Sweden?\n\nI see that there's a lot of available education, such as Komvux, Bachelor, and Masters. Does higher level of education give you higher salary/better position?\n\nAnd what's the difference between Komvux and University education? Are they significantly different?\n\nTo compare, I'm from an Asian country, where here at least you have to be bachelor to get a decent office job. I hold a Bachelor's degree myself with a few years of working experience, and thinking if I should continue for a Master's degree once I move. I'm also currently  working for a Swedish game company but more like as an outsource/monthly freelance.\n\nAdditionally, I'm asking this cus I'm interested in working with the green transformation that is happening in the North, and planning to take International Business for my Masters if needed. Just thinking how necessary will it be since it will take 2years to complete.\n\nFeedbacks and opinions are very appreciated. Thanks.",

    "Women's clinics for foreigners without Swedish health insurance..? Hi!\n\nI've been searching everywhere for this information but absolutely cannot find it.

I have my personnummer but I don't have the state health insurance.\n\nIn the U.S., I'm so used to having very easy and direct access to places like Planned Parenthood. I'm pretty much desperate to have my IUD removed, but I cannot figure out how or where I can get this done for no or very very little cost. I live on an extremely low salary and can't pay more than 500kr to have it removed. I tried calling 1177, but they told me they didn't know of any services that remove IUD's? She told me to call my nearest women's clinic/midwifery clinic.\n\nI tried calling a few of them over multiple days, but every single clinic only has open phone lines for an hour or so a day and they are *constantly* busy. I can never get through to a person because the phone line is full of other people calling.

Im currently here for 3 months and EVERY SINGLE TIME I have visited, my lips burn constantly. I moisturize them very often with a good lip balm that I love but still I can‚Äôt open my mouth too wide without splitting the corners of my mouth and multiple times a day my lips will burn until I put the lip balm on.

    "The date to start counting habitual residence Hej!\n \nI always assumed that the 5 years habitual residence required for citizenship is counted from the date on the first residence permit card (in my case work permit). But I read through the rules on MV again and now finding that it‚Äôs actually starting from the date when the application was submitted? I‚Äôm referring to the second point below: \n\nHow is your period of habi¬≠tual resi¬≠dence counted?\n\n- If you had a permanent residence permit or residence permit for settlement when you entered Sweden, you can count the time from the day you came to Sweden.\n\n- If you did not have a permanent residence permit or residence permit for settlement when you entered Sweden, the time is counted from the date you submitted your application for a residence permit in Sweden.\n\n- If your application for a residence permit in Sweden was denied and then you submitted a new application, the time is counted from the date you received an approval.\n\n\nIf someone here had the experience, could please you clarify what it actually is?",
    "Is this normal in medical care? Using a semi-throwaway account for obvious reasons. Also, this is not a post shitting on Swedish medical care at all, 99.99999% of my experience here has been outstanding. \n\nToday I got my first doctors visit regarding a medical condition that I‚Äôve had for pretty much all my life. Without going into much detail, they couldn‚Äôt do the test to actually confirm the condition (which involved a bone marrow biopsy) as I‚Äôm allergic to anaesthetic, however they did every other test and it lined up with my condition, so I was diagnosed. This condition is extremely rare, and it‚Äôs even rarer to be diagnosed at the age I was. This is well documented but I didn‚Äôt have the papers (my bad). Part of my medical condition leads me to be allergic to a lot of stuff too, which is important as it comes into how the doctor treated me. \n\nWhen I started describing what I was allergic to, he said that it was impossible to be allergic to so many things. He also said that he didn‚Äôt believe that I had the condition I was diagnosed with because it‚Äôs ‚Äúimpossible‚Äù to be diagnosed at that age. He laughed when I said that I needed to develop a plan in case I had a severe reaction. He also refused to prescribe me medication that I know that I can take because ‚Äúit‚Äôs old‚Äù and he didn‚Äôt like it without offering an alternative or a plan to get tested for a new one, which was what needed to happen back home. He said a lot of it was due to anxiety, either from myself, my parents or even my doctors. I also don‚Äôt feel like he listened to how it affects me at all. He kept talking about how bad my quality of life must be, which is a very big assumption to make imo, because yes I need to make adjustments but I‚Äôve grown up with it so I know how to deal with it. There were other things, but this is kind of a high level overview. There was a student doctor in the room also, and they even seemed a little apologetic. \n\nIs this normal in medical care here? I‚Äôve had other times in health care here, with my GP and nurses that gave me vaccines and ER nurses, none of which have been like this. Even the nurses in the hospital during my appointment were really nice. This is my first time ever for a doctor to honestly seem pretty mean, but I‚Äôm unsure if it‚Äôs just a difference in how it‚Äôs approached here. \n\nIf it‚Äôs not normal, is there a way that I could deal with it or report it? Of course I don‚Äôt want it to affect his employment, but it felt unacceptable to me. TIA for any tips.",
    "Does part-time work on a study permit count towards the 5 years required for a citizenship? Hi everyone!  \n\n\nThe first year I was in Sweden I was on a study permit. Now I know that the migrationsverket says that time on a study permit does not count towards the habitual residence period of 5 years required for citizenship. However, I worked part-time during my studies and my salary was above the minimum needed for a work permit and I also paid taxes.   \nMy question is, does the fact that I was paying taxes make any difference in this rule? Is it possible to count my first year in Sweden for the 5 years requirement since I was paying taxes?",

So we moved several months ago from the UK to be closer to my husbands family (hes swedish).. thinking it was a friendlier school system.

The school allows kids to beat eachother up in the play ground (even on the occasion an adult is on duty and standing right there!!!) and let's children run a complete muck and swear in class.. My 7 Yr old was called a F#k boy by another child. As if thats normal??!... And the F bomb seems to be all the kids favourite word here in Gothenburg! It's painful to my ears!!!!!

    "What the fuck is wrong with the healthcare system in Sweden? Due to nature of my job, I had to come to the emergency room (Akuten?) with one of my colleagues because he does not speak English (nor Swedish). The man shat blood and is in severe pain, we've been waiting about 11 hours now and nobody does anything. They took some blood and urine samples and told us that the results look alright and that we have to wait for the doctor. The man is in more pain as time passes and I asked three times for some painkillers or anything that would ease his pain. First time I asked was about 3 or 4 hours ago. I thought this is a first world country with a solid healthcare system.\n\nUpdate, if anyone is interested:\n\nAfter an ecography and an x-ray the situation was still unclear so at around 4AM a dr told us that he'll need an endoscopy and that he'll basically spend what's left of the night there. This will happen I think at around 9AM. We arrived at Akuten around 12PM.

The reason for doing so is, because I got a job at a foreign company that does not have an office in Sweden. I believe this is the easiest way to solve the issue of getting paid for my work (correct me if you know of a better way, of course), since double taxation, tax residency etc can make the process difficult. This way, I can just invoice them every month, that's it.\n\nMy initial questions would be: \n\n* Those who have gone down this path, how did you find the process to be?\n* Would you go for this option again if you had other alternatives?\n* What are some things that surprised you (pleasantly or otherwise)?\n* I heard that if all your company's income comes from a single employer, you might get into trouble, as this is not permitted to circumvent employing people the conventional way.

    "Work visa to Sambo Visa Tjena allihop,\n\nI have been living in Sweden since the end of 2018, working here since 2020, and within that time I met and started living with my partner in 2021 (it was a quick decision but, as we lived a bit far apart and a reliable second hand apartment became available we decided to try it out). As my work permit was set to be renewed at the end of 2022, my partner and I decided to apply as Sambo. I wasn't expecting to get such a quick response but in any case, we received a request for more information which pretty much entailed resubmitting everything we submitted at the end of 2022 since I may have submitted the wrong application at the time. Now, we have received additional requests for information and I am thinking that maybe I need to include more information about our relationship and less about the finances/practicalities , which I believe we have covered , but have only included in addition to the financial/job materials: the apartment contracts with our names, our individual accounts of our relationship (in the application) and one page of our relationship history/pictures (since we have been in Sweden the whole time we don't really have tickets of visits or anything like that) . This additional request for information to me was 'If the application for residence based on connection is denied, will you apply with a work permit apply for  continued residence permit due to work?' and that was it!\n\nFirstly, I am really confused why they would deny the application if we meet all the requirements? I know the best policy is to answer truthfully, but truthfully I don't know what I would do. My partner and I have discussed it a bit and think it would be better for me either to appeal if denied or if in the end it is denied altogether, go back to my country and reapply and possibly without the job although we would hate to do that as now we have built a life together here with even our liten katt :( My job is quite stable and I have been moved to a permanent contract but, my pay is not very good for my area of expertise. In the end, my partner and I both think it would be preferable if I could be in Sweden without being tied to my current job. I feel like I am obligated to stay at my current job because they 'sponsor' me and if I left for another one I am not sure how long it could take between jobs or even if I was laid off for some reason, it would be more secure to be on a permanent residence as opposed to another temporary work permit.\n\nI am really not sure how to answer the question or if I should just call to explain to them why I have applied as a Sambo instead of a work permit?

    "Chances of Criminal Forensic Science jobs in Sweden Hi! I‚Äôm not sure if this is the right forum for my query but I will give it a shot anyway. My fianc√© is non European and she has recently finished her masters in criminal forensic science from University of Amsterdam and is really passionate about it. But unfortunately she has had no luck so far in landing a job in that particular field in Netherlands because of her non European citizenship status. Since these jobs are usually in Police departments, the criteria becomes a default to be a citizen of the country or at least any other European country. But that is not the case with private forensic labs who are outsourced by the Police sometimes. They do not pose such criteria‚Äôs for recruitment. She will be soon moving in with me here in Stockholm and it‚Äôd be great if any of you can share anything that‚Äôd be helpful for her to get a job in criminal forensic science. She also has a background in Biotechnology but not so keen about it. However that is a backup plan for now if a criminal forensic science job in Sweden/EU is a hard no-go.

I have done some research into visas/residence permits and I qualify only for the highly qualified persons residence permit as I have a Master's in International Marketing (and a Bachelor's in Psychology).

    "\"Other Lines of Credit\" When Applying for a Housing Loan I filled out a form for pre-approval for a housing loan. \n\nOne of the questions they asked was: \"Do you have any other lines of credit\". I have a credit card in the US with a typical (for the US) credit limit, which is obnoxiously high by Swedish standards (like 6 months of pay). I added that in as my credit, and the amount I was able to borrow for the loan dropped significantly.\n\nNote: I am not using any of that credit. I tend to put 3000 SEK on this card a month and pay it off at the end of every month. I have had the card for 12 years and have paid it in full at the end of every month the whole time.\n\nMy question is: How will a Swedish bank perceive this when I apply for the actual loan (and not just pre-approval)? \n\nIn the US, having a card with a high credit limit (and which you have regularly paid off) -- is always counted as a good thing, and it will raise the amount the bank trusts you to borrow (because you are considered trustworthy). In fact, If I was planning to buy a house in the US, I would be calling the credit card company to try to raise my limit more because it would end up decreasing my interest rate.\n\nBut perhaps Swedish banks don't see it this way (and instead see it as other debt that I could take on?) That makes some sense, especially because credit cards are less ubiquitous here. \n\nShould I go to the bank and try to explain this when I apply for approval on the home loan? Are they likely to understand the different country contexts? Do I need to call my US bank and have them decrease my credit limit? (I'd rather avoid this if I can just talk to the bank here -- because that will hurt my credit score in the US if we ever move back). \n\nOr maybe I am misunderstanding what the lines of credit question even means (maybe they just mean, money that I owe to other people actively -- not debt that I could take on)?",

    "EU citizen wanting to move to Sweden with a master degree in Clinical Psychology and some work experience in different fields but not licenced+ messed up venting of a 26 years old Hej!\nThis post will be confused, I'm warning you. I hesitated to write it and I'm still not sure what I want to say, I guess it will be a mess of information mixed to the need to vent, but I felt this isna safe space to open up even with a not well cleared mind, so I hope in your warm hearts. \n\nI've done a lot of research on bureaucracy since I'm very anxious, so here it's more about getting something out of my confusion (but if something else I didn't think about comes up I'll be very thankful). \n\nI'm pursuing a master degree hopefully by the end of 2023 in Clinical Psychology. I've lived in Sweden to times: I was an exchange student in 2018/19 and I did an intern as a research assistant in the same University, this was in 2020, and I was weirded out because the first pandemic's wave hit as soon as I started and I had to leave my office to smart working the day after I set it. I don't wanna go deep into this but I believe I was a little traumatised. \nLong story short: I left, enrolled to a MSc in my born country (where I got my BSc aswell), and since then I've been feeling not fitting here anymore. I could stay here but I'm sad. I miss Sweden. I didn't even have the best experience with the local people, but I got to know the culture at least a bit, this to say that I know that living somewhere is different than being on holiday.  \nI know it's dark, cold, grey, desert, silent, lonely, at highly risk of seasonal depression, expensive, hard to find a job in my field, basically impossible to achieve what I want, being an immigrant sucks, dating is impossible, and maybe even something worse. \nBut I built solid reasons in my mind and I have to give it a try, and I need reassurance and advices lol.\n\nSo, work experience: I've worked with disabled adults (18/80) including physical disabilities, hearing impairments and specific learning disabilities (inl√§rningssv√•righeter). I've also worked within the psychiatric care and the rehab field. I have some experience with teens, mostly research related.\n\nWhat can I do in Sweden with this CV, and not a fluent Swedish? I need to make money to survive. I've founded companies like f√∂rsunda or humana to be a personlig assistans. But I don't get if they accept English speakers (and Italian)/Swedish learners. Nor if their contract would let me access the SFI. \nI haven't done much research on that actually, maybe someone knows more? Suggestions on possible slightly related field jobs? Suggestions on volunteering in mental health care in sweden for a non swedish speaker would be also appreciated! Maybe that could be a path. Could that? \n\nIf anyone wants to suggest, I know I can apply for a PhD, I know the process, I know it can be long, I'll do that as soon as I get sure about the graduation date. But honestly I don't think I have many chances, I'm not great at researching. Of course I can take another master degree there in data analysis and give it a chance. But in this uncertainty here I need to make a choice about my career (I'm also getting old lol). And I think that in the long run I would be happier if I'm working with people. This means that I prefer to invest my time on building experience within the mental healthcare other than the research field. I know this is the field where you have to master the language the most, I know. I know it can be not lucrative. I know I have to compete with native speakers as an immigrant (this terrifies me a lot).\n\nI've been studying Swedish more seriously (taking weekly lectures) for a semester and so far Im only A1, my wish is to be at least B1 at the end of this year.. I plan to take a \"final\" course on folkuniversitet and a license. But man I know it's not the hardest language but to me it is. Even English was! I'm just so slow. Every other day I ask myself what the helvete I'm doing and feel DUMB. \n\nAnyway, to end this poem, imo I think it's better to move ASAP since 1.the rules are always changing and who knows there might be soon a sw-exit 2.i need to surround myself with Swedish speakers if I want to have the chance to become fluent. \nBut, will I be able to work al least slightly in my field with my degree as a non swedish speaker, so I can learn the language enough do the training as psychologist there to get licensed (I know the process through socialstyrelsen)?\nOr should I get licensed here and build some more experience and then try to move? \nI can't bare to wait another year, while the immigration rules could change, but this is an important choice for the future I think. \n\nAnd, will I even be able to get proficient?\n\nHave I something to give to your country that makes me worth to be kept there? I think I do, look at me. \n\nSorry for the mess, I warned you. I still hope to receive some inspiring lovely words afterall. Tack allihopa ‚ù§Ô∏è",

    "Planning on moving and doing a MSc at Uppsala Universitet. What should I prepare for? Hi everyone. I am a student in the Netherlands who is aiming to do a MSc in physics at Uppsala University starting potentially in 2024 (I am currently in my second year of my bachelor's and have to apply later this year during my third year). I've thought a lot about where I would like to pursue my masters'. Both for the research groups and personal convenience. At first I thought of Germany. And though it is still on my radar, I am starting to find stronger reasons to go to Sweden after I finish my bachelor's. As I've talked with alumni from my faculty who are currently living and doing their graduate studies at various universities in Sweden. I am primarily hearing a lot of positives. Such as the emphasis on work life balance (even for students), the amount of nature and quiet sceneries (which is something which I personally enjoy a lot) as well as the lack of tuition for EU students. I can imagine that of course it is not all positives. For the good lifestyle, there are higher taxes in contrast to some other EU countries as well as a not-so-pleasant weather. Amongst other things.\n\nBut though I am becoming increasingly more sure about potentially moving to Sweden, I wanted to ask you all here what are some things I should keep in mind in terms of the practicalities and logistics of moving to Sweden (particularly Uppsala). It would be even better if you experienced moving from the Netherlands to Sweden. Though I would appreciate the tip from anyone who has made the jump.\n\n\\- How hard is it to find housing in Uppsala? I heard that the situation is abysmal in Stockholm (which is very much the case in a lot of Dutch cities as well). Is this the case in Uppsala as well?\n\n\\- How would you suggest looking for accommodation? Besides facebook groups, are there sites which could be used to find studios, apartments or rooms in this region?\n\n\\- How long does it take to get a social number in Sweden and how long in advance should I start making the necessary arrangements to obtain this and register in the municipality?\n\n\\- What are the most common internet providers used in Sweden?\n\n\\- What insurances are expected of a Swedish citizen?\n\n\\- How much does public transport roughly cost and how does it work (is there a card or application used)?\n\n\\- Would it be feasible to move some of my belongings with me to Sweden? Such as furniture, household items and books. This is the part that has me the most concerned. As I am aware that there are moving services, but I do not know if it's common to have them help you with a move of such great distances.\n\n\\- Though tuition is technically free, are there still other costs for EU students (such as semester fees)? And is it possible to get a student job?\n\n\\- Lastly, what is the application process like for a masters' at Uppsala? And how likely is it for someone to be admitted?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy sincere apologies for the length of my post.

    "How to find the best price on nappies? Hej, when I lived in UK I used an app called BumDeal to find which supermarket was currently selling nappies at the best price per nappy. It was so useful with a small baby when we bought nappies all the time.  We‚Äôre about to find ourselves needing nappies again soon and I wonder if Sweden has anything similar?\n\nAll I can see that can be used is PrisJakt, but that doesn‚Äôt do really the same thing by helping see best price per nappy upfront.

I‚Äôm honestly not too sure which apartment that‚Äôs making all the noise, so I don‚Äôt know who to approach, but once I figure that out, should I approach them directly?
