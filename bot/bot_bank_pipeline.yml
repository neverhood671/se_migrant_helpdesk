  \n Some banks will create an account for you in the same day, others will ask you to wait for a couple of weeks or even months.
    It is really hard to predict. Even inside the same bank and the same branch situation can be different in different days. We wish you luck!"

     \n Visit one of the local banks branches, take all the documents you have that can confirm that: 
     \n 1. you are going to stay in Sweden for 1 year or more (e.g. employment contract, documents from the university you study in, etc.)
     \n 2. have stable income (e.g. payslips, parental allowance documents, unemployment benefits, etc.)
     \n 3. you are who you say you are (ideally Swedish ID, if you don't have Swedish ID bring you national passport and someone, e.g. you partner or boss, who has Swedish ID and can confirm your identity)"
