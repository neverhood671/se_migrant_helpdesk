     \nTake all the documents you have that can confirm that: 
     \n 1. you are going to stay in Sweden long-term
     \n 2. you have stable income 
     \n 3. you are who you say you are (ideally Swedish ID card, but you can also try with your national passport)
     \n
     \nIf you lack some of the documents the chance of rejection is high. But even if you have all the docs some banks will create an account for you in the same day, others will ask you to wait for weeks or even months.
     It is really hard to predict. Even inside the same bank and the same branch situation can be different in different days. So do not give up, try again in case of rejection. We wish you luck!"
