  especially if you’ll be living in a big city like
  Stockholm, Gothenburg or Malmö.
  You can rent ‘first-hand’ or ‘second-hand’ in Sweden.
  First-hand (första hand) means you sign an agreement
  with the owner of the building, while second-hand
  (andra hand) means you sign an agreement with someone
  who owns the flat or has the first-hand contract on the flat.

  content: "In the big cities, obtaining a first-hand contract
          generally requires several years of queueing.
          If you are considering a longer stay in Sweden,
          you might consider signing up at a “bostadskö” asap.
          Most Swedes sign up as soon as they are allowed
          (nowadays once they turn 18) and the waiting time
          on these “bostadskö” are very long. However,
          if you are patient and not too picky about
          your choice this might be an option.
